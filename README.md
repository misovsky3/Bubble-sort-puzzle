Bubble sort puzzle in JavaFX


1) After starting the application, the main menu will open, where you can choose one
of 4 prepared levels. Levels are sorted by difficulty.
2) After opening the level, the level starts and it is possible to play the game.
The control of transfers between containers is controlled with the mouse, first clicking on the container
from which we want to take and then to which we want to move. Prohibited moves will not be performed.
The player sees the number of transfers made.
3) After successful sorting of balls, a prompt to enter the player's name will open and then it will be saved
to the table score, sorting in the table in ascending order from the number of movements made. If the player does not enter
the name is saved under the name Unnamed.
4) The player has the opportunity to return from the unfinished level to the menu, then a prompt will appear asking if he wants to play
save game. If so, the program will ask for the name of the backup and use this name to save the game
5) In the main menu, the player has the opportunity to load the saved game, select the game he wants to complete and confirm
the game is loading.
6) Also in the main menu it is possible to look in the score table where the player chooses for which level
wants to see statistics and see sorted statistics based on that.
